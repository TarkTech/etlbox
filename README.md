## Why ETLBox

ETLBox is a comprehensive C# class library that is able to manage your whole [ETL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load) or [ELT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_load,_transform).  You can use it to create your own dataflow pipelines programmatically in .NET, e.g. with C#. Besides a big set of dataflow components it comes which some control flow task that let you easily manage your database or simple execute Sql code without any boilerplate code. It also offers extended logging capabilites based on NLog to monitor and anlayze your ETL job runs.

ETLBox is a fully functional alternative to other ETL tools like Sql Server Integrations Services (SSIS). Creating your ETL processes programatically has some advantages: 

**Build ETL in .NET**: Code your ETL with your favorite .NET language fitting your teamâ€™s skills and that is coming with a mature toolset.

**Runs everywhere**: ETLBox runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows. It is written in the current .NET Standard and successfully tested with the latest versions of .NET Core & .NET.

**Run locally**: Develop and test your ETL code locally on your desktop using your existing development & debugging tools.

**Process In-Memory**: ETLBox comes with dataflow components that allow in-memory processing which is much faster than storing data on disk and processing later.

**Manage Change**: Track you changes with git (or other source controls), code review your etl logic, and use your existing CI/CD processes.

**Data integration**: While supporting different databases, flat files and web services, you can use ETLBox as a foundation for your custom made Data Integregation platform.

**Made for big data**: ETLBox relies on [Microsoft's TPL.Dataflow library](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/parallel-programming/dataflow-task-parallel-library) and was designed to work with big amounts of data.


## Getting ETLBox

All [ETLBox packages are available on nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=etlbox). 
You will always need the [main ETLBox package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ETLBox/).
The connectors are in separate packages - depending on your needs, choose the right connector package from the list.
E.g., if you want to connect to SqlServer, use [ETLBox.SqlServer](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ETLBox.SqlServer/).
If you also need to read or write from Csv files then add [ETLBox.Csv](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ETLBox.Csv/).
Having the connectors in separate packages reduces dependencies to 3rd party libraries.
You can use ETLBox within any .NET or .NET core project that supports .NET Standard 2.0. (Basically all latest versions of .NET)

## Data Flow and Control Flow

ETLBox is split into two main components: Data Flow and Control Flow Tasks. The Data Flow part offers the core ETL components. The tasks in the Control Flow allow you to manage your databases with a simple syntax. Both components come with customizable logging functionalities.

### Data Flow overview

ETLBox comes with a set of Data Flow component to construct your own ETL pipeline . You can connect with different sources (e.g. a Csv file), add some transformations to manipulate that data on-the-fly (e.g. calculating a sum or combining two columns) and then store the changed data in a connected destination (e.g. a database table). 

To create your own data flow , you basically follow three steps:

- First you define your dataflow components (sources, optionally transformations and destinations)
- link these components together
- tell your source to start reading the data and wait for the destination to finish

Now the source will start reading and post its data into the components connected to its output. As soon as a connected component retrieves any data in its input, the component will start with processing the data and then send it further down the line to its connected components. The dataflow will finish when all data from the source(s) are read, processed by the transformations and received in the destination(s).

Transformations are not always needed - you can directly connect a source to a destination. Normally, each source has one output, each destination one input and each transformation at least one input and one or more outputs. 

Of course, all data is processed asynchronously by the components. Each compoment has its own set of buffers, so while the source is still reading data, the transformations  can already process it and the destinations can start writing the processed information into their target. So in an optimal flow only the current row needed for processing is stored in memory. Depending on the processing speed of your components, the buffer of each component can store additional rows to optimize throughput.


#### Data Flow example

It's easy to create your own data flow pipeline. This example data flow will read data from a MySql database, modify a value and then store the modified data in a Sql Server table and a csv file, depending on a filter expression.

Step 1 is to create a source, the transformations and destinations:

```C#
var sourceCon = new MySqlConnectionManager("Server=10.37.128.2;Database=ETLBox_ControlFlow;Uid=etlbox;Pwd=etlboxpassword;");
var destCon = new SqlConnectionManager("Data Source=.;Integrated Security=SSPI;Initial Catalog=ETLBox;");

DbSource<MySimpleRow> source = new DbSource<MySimpleRow>(sourceCon, "SourceTable");
RowTransformation<MySimpleRow, MySimpleRow> rowTrans = new RowTransformation<MySimpleRow, MySimpleRow>(
    row => {  
        row.Value += 1;
        return row;
    });
Multicast<MySimpleRow> multicast = new Multicast<MySimpleRow>();
DbDestination<MySimpleRow> sqlDest = new DbDestination<MySimpleRow>(destCon, "DestinationTable");
CsvDestination<MySimpleRow> csvDest = new CsvDestination<MySimpleRow>("example.csv");
```

Now we link these elements together.

```C#
source.LinkTo(trans);
rowTrans.LinkTo(multicast);
multicast.LinkTo(sqlDest, row => row.FilterValue > 0);
multicast.LinkTo(csvDest, row => row.FilterValue < 0);
```

Finally, start the dataflow at the source and wait for the destinations to rececive all data (and the completion message from the source).

```C#
Network.Execute(source);
```

### Data integration

The heart of an ETL framework is it's ability to integrate with other systems. 
The following table shows which types of sources and destination are supported out-of-the box with the current version of ETLBox.
**You can *always* integrate any other system not listed here by using a `CustomSource` or `CustomDestination` - though you have to write the integration code yourself.**

Source or Destination|Support for|Limitations|
---------------------|-----------|------------
Databases|Sql Server, Postgres, SQLite, MySql, MariaDb, Oracle, Db2|Full support
Flat files|Csv, Json, Xml, Text|Full support
Any web service|Json, Xml, Csv, Text|Full support
Office|Microsoft Access, Excel|Full support for Access, Excel only as source
Cube|Sql Server Analysis Service|Only XMLA statements
Memory|.NET IEnumerable & Collections|Full support
Cloud Services|Tested with Azurek|Full support
Any other|integration with custom written code|No limitations

You can choose between different sources and destination components. `DbSource` and `DbDestination` will connect to the most used databases (e.g. Sql Server, Postgres, MySql, SQLite). `CsvSource`, `CsvDestination` give you support for flat files. `ExcelSource` allows you to read data from an excel sheet. `JsonSource`, `JsonDestination`, `XmlSource` and `XmlDestination` let you read and write json or xml from files or web service requests. `TextSource` and `TextDestination` allow access to regular text files with line breaks.  `MemorySource`, `MemoryDestinatiation` as well as `CustomSource` and `CustomDestination` will give you a lot flexibility to read or write  data directly from memory or to create your own custom made source or destination component.

### Transformations

ETLBox has 3 type of transformations: Non-blocking, partially blocking and blocking transformations. Non-blocking transformations will
only store the row that is currently processed in memory (plus some more in the buffer to optimize throughput and performance). Partially blocking transformations will load some data in the memory before they process data row-by-row. Blocking transformations will wait until all data has arrived at the component before it starts processing all records subsequently. 

The following table is an overview of the most common transformations in ETLBox:  

Non-blocking|Partially blocking|Blocking|
------------------------|------------------|---------
RowTransformation|LookupTransformation|BlockTransformation
ColumnRename|CrossJoin|Sort
MergeJoin(always join)|MergeJoin (join on match)|DbMerge
Multicast|Aggregation|
RowDuplication|BatchTransformation|
RowMultiplication|CachedBatchTransformation|
CachedRowTransformation||
Distinct||
XmlSchemaValidation||


*RowTransformation*: This transformation let you modfiy each data record with your custom written C# code

*ColumnRename*: Allows you to rename column names in your data flow.

*MergeJoin*: Join your incoming data into one. Works best with sorted input. You can either always join two rows from the inpts,
or define a match function which determines when the incoming rows are equal and should be joined. 

*RowDuplication*: Simple duplicate your input row x times - additionally, you can add your own condition when to duplicate. 

*RowMultiplication*: Allow you to create multiple rows based on your incoming rows - based on your own custom C# code. 

*Multicast*: Broadcast your incoming data into 2 or more targets.

*CachedRowTransformation*: Work the same way as the row transformations, but stores previously processed row in a cache.

*LookupTransformation*: Allows you to store lookup data in memory and use it for enriching your data in your DataFlow.

*CrossJoin*: Takes two inputs and return one output with each record of both inputs joined with each other. 

*Distinct*: Eliminates duplicates by returning only the first unique of incoming data and discarding duplicates. 

*Aggregation*: Aggregate your data on-the-fly based on Grouping and Aggregation functions.

*BatchTransformation*: Execute your custom written C# code on a batch of incoming data. 

*CachedBatchTransformation*: Works exactly like the BatchTransformation, but stores previously processed batches in a cache. 

*BlockTransformation*: Allows you to execute your own custom written C# on your whole set of incoming data. 

*Sort*: Sorts your input data by your own sort function.

*DbMerge*: Allows you to insert, update or delete data in your target table depending on your incoming data.
No more need to write your own "upsert" statement - the `DbMerge` is supported by all ETLBox databases. The output of the DbMerge
is the changes to your target table (insertions, updates and deletions.)

*XmlSchemaValidation*: Validates a given string that contains xml with a defined Xml schema definition - invalid xml is redirected to 
the error output. 

#### Designed for big data

ETLBox was designed for performance and is able to deal with big amounts of data. All destinations do support Bulk or Batch operations. By default, every component comes with an input and/or output buffer. You can design your data flow that only batches or your data is stored in memory, which are kept in different buffers for every component to increase throughput. All operations can be execute asynchrounously, so that your processing will run only within separate threads.

### Control Flow - overview

Control Flow Tasks gives you control over your database: They allow you to create or delete databases, tables, procedures, schemas or other objects in your database. With these tasks you also can truncate your tables, count rows or execute *any* sql you like. Anything you can script in sql can be done here - but with only one line of easy-to-read C# code. This improves the readability of your code a lot, and gives you more time to focus on your business logic.

Code tells - here is some example code, without writing the whole "boilerplate" code by ADO.NET.

```C#
var conn = new SqlConnectionManager("Server=10.37.128.2;Database=ETLBox_ControlFlow;Uid=etlbox;Pwd=etlboxpassword;");
//Execute some Sql
SqlTask.ExecuteNonQuery(conn, "Do some sql",$@"EXEC myProc");
//Count rows
int count = RowCountTask.Count(conn, "demo.table1").Value;
//Create a table (works on all databases)
CreateTableTask.Create(conn, "Table1", new List<TableColumn>() {
    new TableColumn(name:"key",dataType:"INT",allowNulls:false,isPrimaryKey:true, isIdentity:true),
    new TableColumn(name:"value", dataType:"NVARCHAR(100)",allowNulls:true)
});
```

### Logging

By default, ETLBox uses and extends [NLog](https://nlog-project.org). ETLBox already comes with NLog as dependency - so you don't need to include additional packages from nuget. In order to have the logging activating, you just have to set up a nlog configuration called `nlog.config`, and create a target and a logger rule. After adding this, you will already get logging output for all tasks and components in ETLBox. 

## Where to continue

We recommend that you try ETLBox out. All [ETLBox packages are available on nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=etlbox). 
You will always need the [main ETLBox package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ETLBox/).
The connectors are in separate packages - depending on your needs, choose the right connector packages from the list.
E.g., if you want to connect to SqlServer, use [ETLBox.SqlServer](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ETLBox.SqlServer/), and if you also
need to access Csv files then add [ETLBox.Csv](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ETLBox.Csv/).

The free versions allows you to process up to 10.000 records per connector in a DataFlow.
